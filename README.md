# 4-digit-7-Segment-with-74HC595-without-Libarys
I was interisted how a 4 digit 7 Segment is working with an 74HC595 and it seems to be more complicated than I thought it would be. Now I used an Arduino Uno, 4 digit 7 Segment and one 74HC595 and for programming I used NO LIBARY, I used the Timer1 as an Interupter and well thats it.
